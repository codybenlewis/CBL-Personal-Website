# About

Let’s see. So I grew up in Randolph, NJ, where the town motto is “where life is worth living.” I wont argue how accurate it is, but you’re free to make your own assumptions. Growing up I always loved art, business, and technology, though it wasn’t until I got older that I started to put them together.

I went off to college to Boston Univeristy, studying graphic design and [graduating with honors](https://youtu.be/M1B3gATS0GE?t=877){:target="_blank"} in 2016. I’ve been living in Boston since, most recently working as a Creative Technologist at MullenLowe.

Artist, designer, developer, entrepreneur, art director, copywriter, technologist, dare I say generalist. Everyone seems to have a different label for what I am. I try not to let it matter that much. I make things. If you like them, [let's talk](mailto:cblewisnj@gmail.com?subject=I clicked the %22let%27s talk%22 link on your About page).
