# About

Let's see. I grew up in Randolph, NJ with lifelong interests in art, technology, and business. However it wasn’t until I got older that I started to put those three things together.

I went off to college at Boston University, studying graphic design and [graduating with honors](https://youtu.be/M1B3gATS0GE?t=877){:target="_blank"} in 2016. I’ve been living in the Boston area since, currently working at [Immuta](https://www.immuta.com/){:target="_blank"} as a graphic designer.
