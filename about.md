# About

Let’s see. So I grew up in Randolph, NJ, where the town motto is “where life is worth living.” I won't argue how accurate it is, but you’re free to make your own assumptions. Growing up I always loved art, business, and technology. It wasn’t until I got older though that I started to put them together.

I went off to college at Boston Univeristy, studying graphic design and [graduating with honors](https://youtu.be/M1B3gATS0GE?t=877){:target="_blank"} in 2016. I’ve been living in Boston since, most recently working as a Creative Technologist at MullenLowe.
