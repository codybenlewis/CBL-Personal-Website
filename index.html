  <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s see. So I grew up in Randolph, NJ, where the town slogan was “where life is worth living.” I kid you not. I wont argue how accurate that statement is, but you’re free to make your own assumptions. Growing up I always loved art, business, and technology.
    It wasn’t until I grew older that I started to put them together.

    I went off to college at Boston Univeristy, studying graphic design and graduating with honors *pat on the back* in 2016. I’ve been living in Boston since, most recently working as a Creative Technologist at MullenLowe.

    My entire life I’ve made things.
