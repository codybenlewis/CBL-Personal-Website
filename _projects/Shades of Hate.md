Shades of Hate is a mosaic poster of President Donald Trump using the entire spectrum of thumbs down and middle finger skin tone emoji. The project was put on Kickstarter in October of 2016 in order to produce silkscreen prints of the design, but was ultimately unsuccessful in reaching it's funding goal.

## Here's Why

The race emoji can be uncomfortable, but embracing the diversity that makes up the human spectrum has never been so important. I never liked using the originally default white ones that spawned online racial tension. I also can't use the non-white ones which would be seen as insensitive. Making everything yellow/non-human was intended to be an improvement, but by purposely ignoring diversity we turn a blind eye to the truth. Faced without answers, I began using all the shades.

After sending a long text of gradient skin tones, I took a second to look at deep range of values people come in. We could make a beautiful picture together.

So, I developed a program that converts a black and white image into 6 tones, and overlays it with the appropriate emoji. I used my own face as the base image.

Shades of ✌️ filled my screen until I started testing the program on other photos and ironically input one of presidential candidate (at that time) Donald Trump. Seeing the universal symbol of peace stamped across his face stood in disturbing contrast to the unusually outlandish, hateful, and racist agenda he promoted along his campaign. He deserved an entirely different symbol. I made one.

After the Kickstarter ended, I made and sent postcards of the design as a thank you to the backers and friends that contributed towards the campaign. While the project did fail to gain support from a large enough audience, I'm still extremely proud of the journey and what was created along the way. Win or lose, we will always be stronger together.
