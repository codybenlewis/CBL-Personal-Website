When Burger King was looking for an overly-Americana way to launch the American Brewhouse King Burger, we came up with the Freedom Crown. Inspired by novelty beer helmets of the 80's, and made in partnership with Budweiser, the Freedom Crown holds a cold beer on one side and a large burger on the other. The product was used as a promotion on social media, instantly becoming *the* must-have (and sold-out) 4th of July accessory.
