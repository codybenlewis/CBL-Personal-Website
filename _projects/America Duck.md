America Duck is a jacket enhancing patch designed and funded though Kickstarter. After being contacted by {% include specials/spoiler.html redact="C&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;a G&#42;&#42;&#42;e" %}, who was kind enough to fly my brother and I to their headquarters, I agreed to remove the Kickstarter page from public view. All additional funding went to purchase jackets for Boston's homeless.

## Let's start at the beginning

During my junior year at Boston University, after returning from winter break, I became overwhelmed by the sudden mass of {% include specials/spoiler.html redact="C&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;a G&#42;&#42;&#42;e" %} coats being worn on campus. I figured that I could enhance my generic fleece jacket with a similar patch and blend in for a fraction of the cost.

I quickly created my design and turned to Kickstarter for help funding a minimum production order. With the modest goal of $175 and only mockups to show, the project was live in less than one week.

The campaign met its goal in [less than 10 days](http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/860869947/the-america-duck-embroidered-patch/), organically picking up [media attention](http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/01/27/cheap-canada-goose-coats-in-american-duck-parody/) after the video was added. More people then slowly began connecting with America Duck's purpose, leading it to become a stronger commentary on luxury brands. Backer support ultimately fueled the decision to use additional funding for purchasing jackets, which were later donated to local homeless shelters.

Before the campaign ended, I had a portfolio review with designer Stefan Sagmeister and was able to extract a quote from him about America Duck. He said he liked the project.

Three days after fulfilling all rewards, I received a cease and desist from {% include specials/spoiler.html redact="C&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;a G&#42;&#42;&#42;e" %}'s legal team. While they found the project funny and supported how I used the additional funding, they requested that the America Duck be removed from Kickstarter. At the same time, they generously invited my brother and I to visit their international factory/headquarters and flew us out on April 17, 2015.

We returned home with expensive hats, a coffee table book, a good story, and no maple syrup. I tried and failed to smuggle some home.

The patches are no longer for sale.
