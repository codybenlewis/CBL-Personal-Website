Input is a drawing program and concept sock edition for {% include project-link.html project="stringandloop" %}. Inspired by the [Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/){:target="_blank"}, and string&&loop's [Quick Draw series](https://www.stringandloop.com/shop/quickdrawcat1){:target="_blank"}, this edition of socks would feature 80 separate user submitted drawings, combined to form a single pattern. A version of the main drawing enviroment has been ported below for you to play with.

{% include specials/input.html %}

In development, prototypes with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/){:target=_blank} allowed user accounts to view all the submitted drawings in real time, upload their finished drawing as part of the collection, and load their saved drawing from the cloud to continue editing. They coild also select where on the sock they wanted their drawing to be placed from available remaining plots.

Logistical challenges currently prevent the project from moving beyond a proof of concept.
