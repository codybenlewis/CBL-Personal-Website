In the spring of 2017, Google Creative Lab collected and distrbuted over [50 million open-source drawings](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data){:target="_blank"} as part of its [Quick, Draw! experiment](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/){:target="_blank"}. Wanting an easy way to interface with the data for [string&&loop](/projects/stringandloop), I developed Quick, Draw! for Processing. This Processing library allows users to easily select, manipulate, and animate drawings in their own sketches with advanced control.

It's open source and free to download on Github. Check out the [project repository](https://github.com/codybenlewis/quick-draw-for-processing){:target="_blank"} for installation instructions and documentation.
