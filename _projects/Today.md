key: today

Working with clockmaker Scott Thrift, I produced the gradient design that was used as the face in his conceptual 24-hour timepiece, [Today](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottthrift/today?ref=discovery&term=scott%20thrift). Colors were curated and sequenced to suggest different stages of the day, thereby altering the viewer's perception of time.
