Created in collaboration with [Christian Madden](http://christianmadden.com/){:target="_blank"}, the Apathy Machine is an robot prototype that scrolls and likes every photo on Instagram. Using a capture card and computer vision library [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) a connected program can sense when the machine is over an Instagram post. The end result imitates my brother on his phone at the Thanksgiving table, for which the machine was inspired. Sorry Dylan.
