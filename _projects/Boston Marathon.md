In 2019, JetBlue wanted their Boston Marathon activation to support spectators. Tapping into marathon culture, we came up with the idea to create an on-demand poster printing truck and provide kick-ass signs to those who weren’t able to make or bring their own.

<!-- Working with production vendors, we built and parked a tailer in Coolidge Corner equipped with two industrial Epson roll printers. Using an in-house web app we then generated customized posters by placing messages on top of templated background images. The end result lined Brookline with hundreds of unique JetBlue branded posters, supporting runners on their way to the finish line and bringing a smile to the crowd along the way. -->
