Every year Reddit hold's the world's largerst secret Santa gift exchange. So, when Royal Caribbean was looking for a scrappy way to celebrate the holidays, we decided to make them part of it. Three lucky matches were given a free Royal Caribbean adventure and a suitcase full of personalized, adventure-themed presents.

We won over one of the most brand-averse audiences on the internet, earned over 23 million impressions with no media budget, and made a few deserving people ugly-cry.
