It's a fact. Take the following example caught on film by my friend [Tiffany Lo](https://www.instagram.com/smily_tiffany/){:target="_blank"}. This dog Neptune (nicknamed "Tuna" according to his collar ðŸ¥°) just wandered up to us on the Charles River Esplanade one afternoon. He tried to follow home us after we left. I told him he had to stay with his parents who were sitting nearby. What a good boy.
